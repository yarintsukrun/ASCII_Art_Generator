1. Class Purposes and Relationships:

	ROUND.java: Provides enums (e.g., UP, DOWN, ABS) for brightness matching strategies.

	Shell.java: Acts as the main application controller, handling user input, commands,
	 and program execution. Creating a new Image Class and setting the image,
	 Creating a new SubImgCharMatcher and creating a newAsciiArtAlgorithm class to generate ASCII art.

	AsciiArtAlgorithm.java: Implements the logic to create ASCII art from image data and given
	 SubImgCharMatcher class.

	Image.java: Represents and manipulates image data using a 2D pixel array, providing utilities
	 padding and dividing images.


	CharConverter.java: Converts characters into binary images (boolean 2D arrays).


	SubImgCharMatcher.java: Matches sub-image brightness values to characters, using the ROUND
	strategies and normalizing brightness values.

	Constant.java: for saving all the constants to prevent using magic numbers.


2. Data Structures and Scalability:
	TreeMap in SubImgCharMatcher: Maps brightness values to TreeSet of characters.
	TreeMap is allowing us to search in O(log(n)) with the methods higherEntry, lowerEntry and Get,
	So we used this data structure to search for the closest value (using rounding method)
	to the desired value.
	That value is a TreeSet, which allows us to access all the characters with the same brightness value
	(since there is a limited number of ASCII characters, access within the TreeSet is O(1)).
	Therefore, insertion and deletion of values are O(log(n))



3. Error Handling:
	In the Shell class, Java's exception handling is used to manage user input errors and
	 provide feedback. When errors like incorrect command formats or invalid inputs occur,
	 exceptions like IllegalArgumentException are thrown with specific messages. These exceptions
	 are caught in the Run() function, where error messages are printed to inform the user. This
	 helps maintain system stability and ensures a smooth user experience by
	 allowing users to correct their inputs and try again.



4. Changes in SubImgCharMatcher:
	Added the setRound method to adjust the search strategy in the TreeMap.
